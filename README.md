AutoSmooth for SketchUp
=======================

SketchUp has a feature named
[AutoFold](http://support.google.com/sketchup/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=94865)
which will split faces into smaller pieces when the user tries to modify them
in such a manner that the vertices isn't coplanar any more. When that happens
new edges are created.

AutoSmooth for SketchUp is an extension that will automaticaly make these edges
soft and smooth - ensuring the auto-folded faces appear as one surface when using
the native tools: Move, Rotate and Scale.

It is also compatible with [QuadFace Tools](https://bitbucket.org/thomthom/quadface-tools/)
enabling users to modify native quads with the basic native tools without having
to triangulate them beforehand.
